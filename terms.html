</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(b) When a Paid Plan starts and ends: A Paid Plan will begin when you have selected the relevant ‘Paid Plan’ option (including whether you are on a monthly or an annual billing cycle) and when these terms of service are accepted by you, and will continue until you cancel your Paid Plan on the Billing Page. Where you cancel your Paid Plan: 
</div><div>
</div><div>(1) your Paid Plan will continue until the end of the current billing cycle that applies to your Paid Plan; and
</div><div>

</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(c) Refunds on cancellation of Paid Plan: However, we do understand that sometimes your requirements may change. If you have selected a Paid Plan but then cancel the Paid Plan on the Billing Page within 72 hours after you have accepted these terms of service: 
</div><div>
</div><div>if your Paid Plan has a monthly billing cycle:

</div><div>
</div><div>(d) Account deletion: If you no longer want to use a Free Plan and would like your account deleted permanently, you can do this on your Account page. You should note though that if you do this, you will not be able to reactivate your account and will not be able to retrieve any of the Content or information you have added.
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(e) We can cancel or suspend your plan: Please note that these terms of service allow us to suspend or cancel your Free Plan or Paid Plan in certain circumstances. Also, if we do not receive payment for your Paid Plan, we reserve the right to cancel your Paid Plan.

</div><div><strong>3. Changes to the Terms and the Homes.Bio Service
</strong></div><div>(a) We can change these terms of service: We may change or replace these terms of service at any time if the change is necessary to reflect changed or added functionality of the Homes.Bio Service, for compliance with law, for reasonable commercial reasons, or otherwise to protect our legitimate interests.  
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(b) We may notify you of certain changes to the terms of service: If a change to these terms of service may have a material negative effect on you, we will use our best efforts to advise you of the change in advance (for example, by providing a notification on the Website), and we will aim to do so least 1 month prior to any new terms taking effect. 
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(c) You must check these terms of service for changes: It is your responsibility to check these terms of service from time to time for any changes.
</div><div>
</div><div>

</div><div>
</div><div><strong>4. Accounts
</strong></div><div>(a) You must create an account to use the Homes.Bio Service: To access or use our Homes.Bio Service, you must create an account with us. When you create this account you must provide accurate and up-to-date information. It is important that you maintain and update your details and any other information that you provide to us. 
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(b) You must maintain your password: You agree not to disclose your password to any third party, and you are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use. You will be fully responsible for activities that relate to your account or your password. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(c) You must choose an appropriate username: You may not use, as a username, the name of another person (for example, the name of well-known personalities or a name to which you have no connection), brand, or entity, a name that is not lawfully available for use, or a trade name that is subject to any rights of another person or entity, or a name that is offensive, vulgar, or obscene. In the event that issues arise over the use of particular usernames, for example where another person claims that your username appropriates their name, we will consider the circumstances reasonably and may require you to change your username (and we may then reassign your username). If we have asked you to do this and you refuse, we may suspend or cancel your user account. Importantly, and without impacting the above, we do not permit ‘domain squatting’ or ‘domain parking’ or similar, and we may reclaim and reallocate usernames that we reasonably believe have been created for these purposes.
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(d) Your responsibilities regarding the use of your account: You must not use your user account or allow it to be used in a way which may (in our opinion) cause damage to or impair the Homes.Bio Service or our reputation, or infringe or violate any third party rights, or violate any applicable laws or regulations.

</div><div> 
</div><div>

</div><div>(B) the Content will not or could not be reasonably considered to be obscene, inappropriate, defamatory, disparaging, indecent, seditious, offensive, threatening, abusive, liable to incite racial hatred, discriminatory, blasphemous, in breach of confidence or in breach of privacy. In some circumstances, Content which in one country would not infringe the previous requirements could do so in another country (and we reserve the right to take whatever action we think necessary in such circumstances including removing Content or restricting access to the Homes.Bio Service);
</div><div>
</div><div>(C) the Content will not be misleading or deceptive, be intended or designed to misinform, would be likely to misinform a reasonable person, and that you will not represent as fact something which is false;
</div><div>
</div><div>(D) the Content will not be unsolicited, undisclosed or constitute unauthorised advertising or endorsements of any product;
</div><div>
</div><div>(E) the Content does not contain software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software, hardware or telecommunications equipment; and
</div><div>
</div><div>(F) the Content does not and is unlikely to bring us or the Homes.Bio Service into disrepute.
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(d) Keeping records: You agree to keep all records necessary to establish that your Content does not violate any of the requirements of this clause and make such records available upon our reasonable request.
</div><div>
</div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>(e) Our right to monitor and modify your Content: We are under no obligation to regularly monitor the accuracy or reliability of your Content incorporated into the Homes.Bio Service. We reserve the right to modify or remove any Content at any time.
